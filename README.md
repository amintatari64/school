I'm glad you're visiting my project. Although this is my first practical experience in project development, I have tried to provide a simple management system for schools. The project is designed to allow users with different levels of access, from students with the least access to teachers and administrators with the most.

Administrators can manage users, delete or add them. They also have the ability to view and, if necessary, modify the grades of students. One unique feature of administrators is the ability to send announcements to all users (teachers, students). Other users can view announcements by logging into their user accounts.

Special features for teachers include viewing, recording, and modifying student grades. Students do not have any special features and can only use the general panel features, such as sending and receiving messages to other users, viewing their grades, and checking the announcement board.

To set up the project, please refer to the `important.txt` file. Any feedback and suggestions you have for improving the project are highly valued. I hope you enjoy this project, and if you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact me.
